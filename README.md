I would never recommend using this to join the queue related to season passes for a popular UW-Madison sport. Don't do it. You can find more useragents online if 10 isn't enough.

I did not find proxies necessary but in the future if they are needed

You can also plug in a fingerprint API but I think that is overkill: https://bablosoft.com/
